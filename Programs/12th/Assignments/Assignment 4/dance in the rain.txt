Come, dance in the rain with me
Let it wash our cares away
Drench us through and set us free
If only for today

Let it wash our cares away
Don't worry about tomorrow
If only for today
Along my path, please follow

Don't worry about tomorrow
This shower soon will end
Along my path, please follow
Cast worry to the wind

This shower soon will end
The memory, it will linger
Cast worry to the wind
Sate the primal hunger

The memory, it will linger
Drench us through and set us free
Sate the primal hunger
Come, dance in the rain with me.
