Dear Friend,

We would like to invite you to join us for lunch on Sunday, 3rd May 2020 at 1p.m as we celebrate the closure of lockdown period.

The Party would be at our home and it would be an informal gathering.

We hope you would be able to make it convenient to attend the party.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Warm Regards,
