	<p>Our environment consists of all naturally ocurring living and non-living things around us, from the colossal blue whale and gargantuan redwoods to miniscule 	microorganisms and tiny plankton - the biotic components.</p>
	<p>Our environment has existed for millions of years before the advent of modern humans and will probably exist for millions more after the last human dies out 	</p>

      The major problems affecting the Earth's environment today are: 
	<ul>
	 <li> Pollution </li>
	 <li> Climate Change or Global Warming </li>
        </ul>
	<h3><a name = "Pollution"> Pollution: </a></h3>
        <p> Pollution is one of today's biggest threats to the environment. Though the various types of pollution have been exponentially multiplying along with the 	human population, water, air and land pollution are the biggest concerns. Recent studies have revealed that plastic has found its way into our food systems 	now. Large swathes of water surrounding large coastal or port cities have become clogged with plastic wastes. Industries based on river banks and sea shores 	continue to dispose of their affluents into these water bodies. </p>
	<h3><a name = "Climate Change"> Climate Change </a></h3>
 	<p> Climate change has become the greatest concern of scientists across the globe. The effects global warming are not just limited to an increase in global 	temperature. This increase will cause, and has already begun causing, other more catastrophic events. Ice sheets that cover Antarctica and glaciers across the 	world will start, and have already started, to melt, increasing sea levels and flooding low lying areas. The increase in temperature would disrupt weather 	patterns across the world - affecting the global food supply -  and prove adaptations of certain species to be futile - causing their extinction.</p>

     <p>Though the picture I have just painted of our future was an extremely dark one, there is still hope. Individual actions can have enormous effects - the 	Butterfly Effect. Small things, like remembering to switch appliances that aren't being used, using energy efficient appliances, reducing water and energy         wastage, walking to places within a short distance instead of using scooters. But we must begin to mount pressure on those who have the maximum effect on all 	of this - industries and the government. Measures taken by them and followed stringently will ensure the check of the dire consequences mentioned above.
