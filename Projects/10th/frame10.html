			<p>The academic year consists of two semesters. Each term will have two formative assessments and one summative assessment. <b>Formative   assessment</b> will be a tool for the teacher to monitor the student’s progress whereas <b>Summative assessment</b> will be the terminal assessment of the student’s   performance.  With these concepts, the teacher will be able to continuously monitor the student’s progress in a supportive and non-threatening environment.   Assessments done periodically will be shown to the  parents so as to encourage their effective participation towards improvisation.</p>
