   <p><p>Travel can be defined as the movement of people between distant places, by any means - airways, waterways, overland -         and can include short stays between movements. Reasons for travel can include recreation, tourism, research, visiting people, volunteer work, migration,        religious trips, business travel and many other reasons, all varying from person to person. Travel has an extremely lengthy history, dating back to     antiquity,    with the Greeks and Romans, and the later piligrimages of the European and Islamic world.</p>
   <p> Travel in the modern world has become a complicated affair, with passports, visas, customs and various other regulations. Still, airports, seaports and other    places that facilitate travel are still booming.</p>

    Sustainable tourism is the concept of visiting a place as a tourist and trying to make a positive impact on the environment, society, and economy. In most cases,     it is limited to reducing or trying to eliminate one's detrimental impact on the environment and ecology of any place one visits. In today's world, sustainable         tourism is the need of the hour. Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste are generated by the toursim industry globally on an annual basis. Aside from this,     growing lifestyle standards are creating the need for the establishment of more hotels and other facilities required to facilitate tourists, degrading the local     environment. To reduce our impact on the global environment and prevent the collapse of a global industry, let us all join hands and do our part in trying to save     the planet.
