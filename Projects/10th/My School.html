    <font size = "3" color = "black" align = "left">
     <p> I have studied in Jnana Sweekar on before, but rejoined after a breif stint abroad (Learn more about that
      <a href="Travel and Tourism.html" title="Travel and Tourism"> here </a> 
      ) - the first time was from Class 4 to Class 6. </p>
     <p> Standards of discipline and for classworks and homeworks have a high set bar. The school is equipped with a range of facilities competent enough to support       and develop the talents of its wide range of students. The teachers are enthusiastic about their individual subjects, and esnure that students constantly put           their best into whatever they do. Overall, the school is a very good one, my experience with it being quite a pleasant one. </p>
